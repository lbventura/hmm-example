"""Amino-acid alphabet, residue indexing, and background frequencies.

This module is the single source of truth for the 20-letter canonical
amino-acid alphabet and the background ("null model") frequencies used to
turn raw log-probabilities into log-odds bit scores.

## The 20 canonical amino acids

Each residue is identified by its IUPAC one-letter code:

    A  Alanine        C  Cysteine       D  Aspartate      E  Glutamate
    F  Phenylalanine  G  Glycine        H  Histidine      I  Isoleucine
    K  Lysine         L  Leucine        M  Methionine     N  Asparagine
    P  Proline        Q  Glutamine      R  Arginine       S  Serine
    T  Threonine      V  Valine         W  Tryptophan     Y  Tyrosine

## Robinson & Robinson background frequencies

Robinson & Robinson (1991) tabulated amino-acid frequencies across a large
curated protein dataset and reported the resulting compositional fractions.
These serve as the null ("background") model: the prior probability that a
random position in a generic protein is each amino acid.  Dividing
position-specific emission probabilities by these values produces log-odds
scores that are positive when a residue is over-represented relative to the
background.

## Swiss-Prot

Swiss-Prot is the manually annotated and reviewed section of UniProtKB (the
Universal Protein Resource Knowledgebase), maintained by the Swiss Institute
of Bioinformatics (SIB) and EMBL-EBI.  Robinson & Robinson derived their
frequencies from an early Swiss-Prot release, making Swiss-Prot composition
the conventional background for profile-HMM scoring.
